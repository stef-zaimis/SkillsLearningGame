## Gameplay

The gameplay loop involves traversing a map consisting of a randomly generated map, at the end of the map there is a boss battle. In the map there are multiple different types of levels: 
- A basic battle, depicted by a minion icon.
- A quiz battle, depicted by a question mark icon.
- A rest game, depicted by a campfire icon.

### Basic Battles
In the basic battle, you are given a certain amount of power which regenerates each round. Your current amount can be seen in the gold circle in the top right of your screen. The amount of power you have corresponds to the number of cards you can play in one turn. Once your power has been depleted you must end your turn, however you can end your turn before this happens. You play a card by dragging it either onto the player or the enemy.

The aim of the basic battle is to defeat the enemy by depleting their health bar to 0. When you defeat an enemy, you are given the choice of receiving a new card. If you choose to get a new card, you must answer a computer science question from a topic of your choice. If you answer the question correctly the card will be added to your deck.

Regardless of the outcome of the question you will be able to progress.

### Quiz Battles
Quiz Battles can be accessed in multiple different ways. The timed quiz battle is part of the map, but you can also press the question mark at the top of your screen to access the free play quiz battle.

In the Quiz Battle you must answer as many questions as possible. Correctly answering a question will give you points, which can be spent in the shop, corresponding to the difficulty of the question.

In the timed quiz battle, to pass the level you must answer at least 50% of the questions you answer correctly.

The free play quiz battle at the top of your screen gives you the options to choose what settings are used for the quiz battle, these include the amount of time given, difficulty of questions and subject type. In the timed quiz battle all settings are decided for you.

### Rest Minigame

The rest game is a binary minigame which allows you to heal your player each time you complete a round. In each round you are given a randomly generated number, and you must show the binary representation of the number using the tick boxes.

You can exit the rest game at any time.

## Questions

All questions in the game are generated from IBM’s [Skills Build](https://skillsbuild.org). Skills Build also contains video content about the topics you can watch for free as a student.

Questions are a core part of the gameplay and can be used to acquire for cards for your deck and to earn points. There are 4 different subjects that questions are based on. These are:

### Artificial Intelligence

### Threat Intelligence

### Cloud

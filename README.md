## Project Overview

Our project is a futuristic sci-fi roguelike card game where players must combat a series of enemies. Upon successfully defeating a foe, players are asked multiple choice questions surrounding various topics in computing taken from the IBM Academic Initiative and Skills Build sites.
Upon answering a question correctly, they can add more powerful cards to their starting deck of initially unimpactful cards. The player wins after defeating all enemies, and loses if they die.

Our learning experiences are to be taken from IBM's [Skills Build](https://skillsbuild.org).

You can read more about our plan in our [Design Document](https://github.com/spe-uob/2023-SkillsLearningGame/blob/dev/Docs/Skills%20Learning%20Game%20-%20Design%20Document.pdf).


## About our Client
Our client is IBM (International Business Machines Corporation). They are a global technology innovator, leading advances in AI, automation and hybrid cloud solutions.

IBM operate a platform called [Skills Build](https://skillsbuild.org), which provides free, online, skills-based learning and support for all ages, developed by technology experts. The platform helps teach about a range of topics, for our project we are focused on 4 main topics, Artificial Intelligence, Threat Security, Cloud and Data Science.

## User Stories
1. **IBM:**
   - As a representative of IBM, I want a fun, interactive game which can effectively showcase and integration various resources taken from our Skills platform, allowing for it to be promoted as a valuable tool for learning and development in computing and technology.

2. **Computer Science Students:**
   - As a Computer Science student, I want to learn in an engaging and inactive way. This approach should help sustain my interest in the subject and motivate continuous learning. The game should offer a blend of educational content and entertainment, making complex topics in computing more accessible and less daunting.
  
3. **Beginners Exploring Computer Science:**
   - As someone with limited or no background in computer science, I am looking for an entertaining experience which can subtly introduce me to basic concepts in computing, making it a fun way to potentially start learning about a new field.

4. **Educators:**
   - As an educator, I want a game which can be used as a supplementary teaching tool, covering fundamental and advanced topics in computer science in a way that complements traditional teaching methods, which I can recommend to students to reinforce classroom learning and stimulate interest.
